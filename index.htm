            <img src="/practic/images/Nameless_King.webp">
            <div class="about">
                <p><span>With FromSoftware's launch of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/1245620/"> Elden Ring </a>, the term "Soulsborne" has once again entered <br> the gaming vernacular.
                If you're confused about its definition, here's what you need to know about <br> Soulsborne, Soulslike, and why they matter.</p></span>

            <h2>What Does "Soulsborne" Mean?</h2>
            <p><span>While there's no agreed-upon definition, the term <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Souls_(%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80)">"Soulsborne"</a> typically refers to games developed <br> by FromSoftware that follow
                 a specific set of rules. In short, they are challenging third-person action <br> games that rely on stamina-based combat, experience points
                 that are lost upon death, and a loose <br> narrative structure that leaves it up to the player to unravel its mysteries. 
                 They also tend to be set in bleak, <br> unforgiving worlds although the specific setting can vary drastically between each entry.</span></p>
                 <br>
                 <p><span>
                 The subgenre was started with the launch of <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon%27s_Souls">Demon's Souls</a> in 2009, 
                 although it didn't explode in popularity <br> until several years later. The moniker Soulsborne refers to both the Souls lineup
                 and <a href = "https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodborne">Bloodborne</a> which was <br> widely considered to be the developer's best game before Elden Ring.</span></p>
                <img src="/practic/images/Elden_Ring_Tip1.png">
                <p><span>Depending on who you ask, a "Soulsborne" game might incorporate any (or all) of the following:</span></p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="">Loose Narrative:</a> Few cutscenes and plotlines are offered to the player. The narrative unfolds <br> 
                        by exploring your world and uncovering new secrets, talking with NPCs, and slaying bosses. <br> There may
                         or may not be a quest log, but almost certainly there will be no quest markers or <br> anything indicating 
                         your next destination.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <span><a href="">Stamina-Based Combat:</a> Your attacks, blocks, and dodge rolls all consume stamina. Perform <br> 
                        too many actions, and you'll be left exposed. Combat also tends to be unforgiving, with just <br> a few missteps leading to death.</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <span><a href="">Pattern Memorization:</a> Enemies tend to signal their attacks before unleashing them, giving <br>
                        you the chance to evade them. Most games in the genre require you to memorize these <br> attack 
                        patterns in order to be successful.</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <span><a href="">Bonfires:</a> Called "Sites of Grace" in Elden Ring, these locations offer a reprieve from the action. <br> 
                        They allow you to check your status, upgrade your attributes, and offer something of a checkpoint.</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <span><a href="">Oppressive Environment: </a> Everywhere you look, there's something trying to kill you. Few locations are <br> 
                        safe from harm, and there's an ever-present feeling that the world is bearing down on you.</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <span><a href="">Progression System:</a> Whether you're unlocking new weapons, reaching new environments, <br> 
                            or upgrading your attributes, the subgenre is constantly giving you ways to feel like you're <br> 
                            making progress towards the end of the game.</span>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <span><a href="">Loss of Experience Upon Death: </a> If you are holding any unused experience points <br>
                              (often called Souls or Runes), you'll drop them upon death. You're then free to pick <br>
                              them back up in a subsequent run, although if you die a second time they'll be lost forever.</span>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span>In short, a Soulsborne game is a difficult-but-fair game developed by FromSoftware that offers <br>
                         challenging combat, a loose narrative, and a bleak world to explore.</span></p>

                            <p><span>A Soulslike game is one that copies many elements of the Soulsborne genre, although it isn't necessarily <br>
                                     made by FromSoftware. It can also deviate from the set formula and its requirements are a bit more <br> flexible. 
                                     For example, it could offer challenging, stamina-based combat, a robust progression system, <br> but be set in a 
                                     world that's a bit less oppressive than the Lands Between. Many people use it to simply <br> describe a game that's difficult
                                    although others don't believe it holds true to the term's original intent.</span></p>
